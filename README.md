## Overview

This library provides tooling for data visualizations. At this point it is restricted to charts:

* It provides Scales, an entity to map domains to ranges. This is useful to map data to viewports. Scales are composable.
* It provides ticks calculation. This is useful for defining nice ticks on axis based on several demands.
* It provides various interpolations for smooth curves. 
* It provides path utilities to generate path strings for svg rendering.
